# Arduino-Latching-Button-with-Auto-Sleep

# Description

Arduino. The LED toggles its state (ON/OFF) with each button press. If no interaction occurs for a certain period, the Arduino automatically enters power-down sleep mode to save battery. When the button is pressed again, the Arduino wakes up and resumes operation.
